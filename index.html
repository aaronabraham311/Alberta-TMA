			<h2> A New Kind of Math Contest </h2>
			<p>Math contests have traditionally focused on individual performance and personal ingenuity; but we at Alberta TMA believe that mathematics is not individualistic. The beauty of math is most clearly seen in a synergy of intelligence of multiple mathematicians.</p>
			<p>This experience cannot be taught, but it must be experienced. To this end, we introduce a new kind of contest that focuses on team performance built upon layers of collaboration and indivdiual competence.</p>
			<p>Come on down and sign up for this one-of-a-kind contest, and help grow your collaborative mathematics skills.</p>
